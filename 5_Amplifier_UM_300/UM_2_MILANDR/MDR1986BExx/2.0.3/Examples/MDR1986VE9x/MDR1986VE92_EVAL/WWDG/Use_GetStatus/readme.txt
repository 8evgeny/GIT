@par Example Description

This example shows how to use WWDG module functions.
That action includes the following steps:
    - WWDG module initialization;
    - Check whether the EWI flag is set or not;
    - EWI flag clearing;
    - Counter value setting.

LED1 is used to indicate the EWI flag state.


@par Directory  contains:

    - main.c             Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VE92 eval board with MDR1986VE92 microcontroller.
    - VD3 (LED1) are connected to PC.0 pin.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_config.h
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
        MDR32F9Qx_wwdg.c
    - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
