@par Example Description

This example provides a description of how to use two DMA channels to transfer a data
buffer from memory to SPI_TX(SSP1) through SPI_RX(SSP1).
For SSP1 DMA Tx/Rx requests are enabled.
In this example both transmission and reception are managed through DMA and the received
data are stored into buffers declared in the SRAM. The DMA channels involved in this
transfer depend on the used SPIs.
A polling on all Transfer complete flags are done for all used DMA channels to check the
end of all DMA channels transfers.
The transmitted and received buffers are compared to check that all data have been correctly
transferred.


@par Directory contains:

    - main.c            Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR1986VE93 eval board with MDR1986VE93 microcontroller.
    - Connect SSP1 TXD pin (X25.1.19) to SSP1 RXD pin (X25.1.22).

@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Libraries" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_config.h
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
        MDR32F9Qx_ssp.c
        MDR32F9Qx_dma.c
    - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_config.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
