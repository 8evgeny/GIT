 \brief This file describes how to work with UID

        The unique device identifier is ideally suited:
            - for use as serial numbers (for example USB string serial numbers or other end
            applications)
            - for use as security keys in order to increase the security of code in Flash memory while
            using and combining this unique ID with software cryptographic primitives and
            protocols before programming the internal Flash memory
            - to activate secure boot processes, etc.

        The 96-bit unique device identifier provides a reference number which is unique for any
        device and in any context. These bits can never be altered by the user.
        The 96-bit unique device identifier can also be read in single bytes/half-words/words in
        different ways and then be concatenated using a custom algorithm.
