    - main.c                  Main program


@par Hardware and Software environment:

    - This example is intended to run on MDR1986BE4 eval board with MDR1986BE4T1 microcontroller.


@par How to use.

To launch the example, you must do the following:
    - Create a project and setup all project configurations.
    - Add main.c file.
    - Add the required files from "Library" folder:
        MDR32F9Qx_config.h
        MDR32F9Qx_port.c
        MDR32F9Qx_rst_clk.c
        MDR32F9Qx_uart.c
    - Edit the MDR32F9Qx_conf.h to set appropriate run-time parameter checking level.
    - Compile and link together all .c files and load your image into the target board.
    - Run the example.
